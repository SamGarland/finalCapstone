# Bookstore Manager
## Final Capstone Project

This programme allows a user to access and manipulate a database 'ebookstore_db'. This is important in helping a bookstore manager easily keep track of and update stock. 

## The programme has the following parts:
1. Opens the database and creates a cursor object.
1. Attempts to create and fill the table 'books'. If the table already exists, this is skipped.
1. Lists a series of functions (enter_book, update_book, delete_book and search_book) that are called in the user menu.
1. Gives an interactive user menu. 

## Installation and Setup
if you don't have Python installed, you can do this via $ pip install python in the command line. Alternitavely, use the guidance in the following link:

## Usage
